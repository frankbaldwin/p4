		<h1>Welcome to MyGolf Handicap Calculator</h1>
		<p>Based on the USGA handicap system, this free app will help you to compute your
			18-hole handicap index for scores posted from multiple golf courses (of 3,000 yards or more in length).</p>
			<p>Using this calculator will not provide you with an "official" USGA Handicap.
				 You need a membership in a qualifying organization for that. However, the resulting number is correct.</p>
